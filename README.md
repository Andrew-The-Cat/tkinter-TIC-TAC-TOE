# Currently main.sh only works on Linux

1. To run first make sure you have python and tkinter installed
2. Run main.sh and enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe

## To run on windows you can run python3 main.py from the src folder directly. Still, make sure to have python and tkinter installed

### PS: Gonna add windows support and automatic python installation when I feel like it
feel free to make those scripts and create a pull request if you wanna help out, ideally in the files linux.sh and windows.bat
