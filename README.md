# Currently only works on Linux

1. To run first make sure you have python and tkinter installed
2. Run main.sh and enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe

### PS: Gonna add windows support and automatic python installation when I feel like it; 
feel free to make those scripts and create a pull request if you wanna help out, ideally in the files linux.sh and windows.bat
